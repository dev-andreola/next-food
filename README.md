# Uai Food

## Overview

Uai food is a project where I was able to study the entire construction of an e-commerce for Ifood-style restaurants.

It was very interesting to develop the entire front-end and back-end of a delivery service ecosystem, learning about client and server components and how to integrate them into the application components, since it is necessary to communicate with the database in the back-end and persist data across states on the front-end.

Still in the development process...
